# BayesianNetworks
AI Assignment 1
CRC remains a major global health crisis due to its high incidence
and mortality rates. Therefore, timely and appropriate intervention
is critical to improving survival. However, treatment decisions must
balance uncertain factors such as patient risk, diagnostic accuracy,
symptom severity, and potential adverse effects.
The objective of this project is to develop a Bayesian Network
model to determine whether to initiate treatment for suspected
CRC cases. The model integrates patient risk, symptoms, diagnostic evidence, and treatment side-effect probabilities to support
evidence-based, individualized clinical decisions.
